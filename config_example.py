# API Configuration Template
# Copy this file as "config.py" and add your real API key

# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to "config.py"
# 2. Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key
# 3. config.py is in .gitignore so it won't be committed to GitHub
